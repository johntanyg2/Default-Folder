Therefore, you should not rely upon it for taking any action without first confirming its accuracy and completeness with your Citi representative. We do not accept any responsibility for any loss or damage that results if you take action without first contacting your Citi representative to confirm the accuracy and completeness of your account data via the Service. In the event of any discrepancy between the information you view via the Service and your account statements, advices and confirmations, the latter shall be considered the official records of the account(s) to which they relate.

Dated Information or other dated material contained via the Service reflects the authors’ analysis as of the published date.

Additional Terms and Conditions for the Documents Section of the Service
Before you can upload and store documents, data, text, reports, images or other material (collectively, “Documentation”) relating to your Citi relationship to the Documents section of the Service (the “Documents Section”), you must first agree to these additional terms and conditions which are intended to supplement and not replace, modify or waive any other section of these Citi Private Bank In View Terms of Use. We may update the Citi Private Bank In View Terms of Use and/or these Terms and Conditions for the Documents Section from time to time and you will need to accept and agree to the revised terms in order to continue your use of the Documents Section. If you do not agree you will no longer be able to access any Documentation stored in or otherwise use the Documents Section.
A. Purpose. The Documents Section is a free document repository for Citi clients and prospective clients intended to facilitate the sharing of Documentation with your Citi representatives and other Citi employees who may need to access or review the Documentation in connection with servicing your account relationship, or in relation to any pre-account opening requirements or in relation to any account opening interest/request made by you. The Documents Section facilitates your delivery of Documentation to Citi without the need to deliver a physical copy via mail, courier, facsimile, e-mail or other similar means and also provides for storage of such Documentation in a manner that is accessible to both you and Citi. The Documentation you may store in the Documents Section must be related to your existing or prospective relationship with Citi. You should be aware that uploading a document to the Documents Section is similar to sending a hard- or soft-copy document to Citi. This means that any Documentation you upload to the Documents Section may be backed up on other Citi systems and record retention tools such that even though you may delete a document from the Documents Section, a copy of it may be retained elsewhere by Citi in accordance with our document retention policies and requirements.
THE DOCUMENTS SECTION IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR RETAINING COPIES OR ORIGINALS OF ALL DOCUMENTATION.
B. Security. Citi protects Documentation in the Documents Section by maintaining physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We train our employees in the proper handling of confidential and personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the information that they receive. Please note that despite our best efforts, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure when you upload Documentation to the Documents Section. Passwords and login information used by you to access the Documents Section must be kept secret.
C. Transmission. Documentation may be sent through web or mobile networks that can result in interstate and global transmissions even though you are physically located within one jurisdiction at the time of transmission or use of the Documents Section. By agreeing to these terms of use you consent to transmission, storage and maintenance of your Documentation across borders and within multiple jurisdictions regardless of your location.
D. Limitations on Use. There are limitations to what you may upload to the Documents Section. YOU AGREE TO USE THE DOCUMENTS SECTION ONLY FOR PURPOSES AS PERMITTED BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. Citi reserves the right to limit the amount of storage capacity made available to you. If your use of the Documents Section intentionally or unintentionally threatens Citi’s ability to provide the Documents Section or other systems, Citi shall be entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect the Documents Section and Citi’s systems, which may include blocking your access to the Documents Section and/or removing your Documentation.
E. Prohibited Use. You agree that you will not use the Documents Section to upload, transmit or otherwise communicate, back up or store any information, data, text, graphics, software, sound, photographs, messages or other material that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of others’ privacy, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; that harms minors, that infringes on patents, trademarks, copyrights or proprietary rights of others; that violates any export restrictions concerning technical or non-technical information from or to the United States or elsewhere; violates any applicable law, rule or regulation including but not limited to international laws, regulations promulgated by any applicable self-regulatory organization. Use of the Documents Section for illegal, fraudulent or abusive purposes may be referred to law enforcement authorities or any government or self-regulatory organizations without notice to you.
F. Retention. Your Documentation may be retained by Citi for periods of time and in a form as determined by us or required or permitted by applicable law, rule or regulation, business practice or Citi policy or procedure. In some cases, Citi may be required to indefinitely retain Documentation permitted as required under applicable law, rule or regulation or the administration of Citi’s business. You acknowledge that Citi may or may not pre-screen Documentation, but that Citi shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Documentation. Without limiting the foregoing, Citi shall have the right to remove any Documentation that violates these Terms of Use or is otherwise objectionable.
G. Access and Disclosure. Documentation stored in the Documents Section is subject to access and review by Citi, and its employees, service providers, contractors, affiliates, consultants, auditors, attorneys and other agents and representatives who perform functions related to Citi and the Documents Section. Such functions include but are not limited to investigation of complaints, compliance with applicable laws, service of your use of the Documents Section, and service, support, administration, review or regulation of your existing or prospective relationships with us and to otherwise administer our business.
Documentation stored in the Documents Section may be made available under applicable law, rule, regulation or legal process to government, regulatory and self-regulatory agencies and may be disclosed to third parties, legal, regulatory or self-regulatory authorities when Citi reasonably believes that such action is necessary to conform with legal and regulatory requirements or inquiries, comply with legal processes, respond to claims that any Documentation violates the rights of third parties or protect or defend the rights, property, legal, personal or financial interests of Citi or others.
H. Service Disruptions. From time to time, the Documents Section may be unavailable due to various factors including but not limited to system maintenance downtime. As with any web and mobile based system, the operation of the Documents Section is inherently subject to interruptions and delays resulting from software operation, equipment and connection failures, traffic loading variations and other circumstances beyond our control. These problems may result in data not being delivered, loss of personalization settings, an inability to access the Documents Section and delayed or failed delivery or storage of the Documentation. You understand and agree that due to the nature of the web and mobile networks, Citi cannot always foresee or anticipate such technical or other difficulties that might arise regarding the Documents Section.
I. Change or Discontinuation. Citi reserves the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Documents Section at any time without notice. In order to maintain the security and integrity of the Documents Section and for other reasons that we in our sole discretion deem appropriate we may also suspend access to the Documents Section at any time without notice. Upon any discontinuation of the Documents Section, Citi shall have no responsibility or obligation to you to provide you with access to your Documentation or to retain such Documentation.
J. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS. CITI, ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND CONTRACTORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AND DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERUPTED USE OR TITLE OR NONINFRINGEMENT, AS TO THE DOCUMENTS SECTION OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNLESS DISCLAIMING SUCH WARRANTIES IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
K. LIMITIATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT CITI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, THE PROVISION OF THE DOCUMENTS SECTION, OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE DOCUMENTS SECTION BY YOU, MODIFICATION OR DISCONTINUATION OF THE DOCUMENTS SECTION.
L. Indemnification. You hereby indemnify and hold harmless Citi and its service providers and contractors, individually and jointly, from and against any third party losses, claims, judgments, fees, costs (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees), caused by or arising out of or in any way related to your violation or breach of any terms, representations or warranties contained in these Terms of Use.
M. Agreement, Modification of Terms. These Terms of Use set forth the agreement and understanding between the parties as to the subject matter of these Terms of Use and supersedes all prior oral agreements, discussions, negotiations, promises, proposals, representations, and understandings between the parties to the Terms of Use with regard to the subject matter hereof and applies in addition to any terms and conditions applicable to your relationship with Citi or your request/interest to open an account with Citi.These Terms of Use may be modified, amended or updated from time to time by us upon notice to you either in writing or by posting to the Documents Section. Your continued use of the Documents Section after notice of such modification, amendment or update has been posted or otherwise made available to you will be understood as your acceptance of the changes and an agreement to be bound by the new terms of use, as amended. If you do not agree to the changes, you agree to discontinue your use of the Documents Section. The most current version of these Terms of Use will be posted at the web site or mobile application through which the Documents Section is made available to you. You acknowledge and agree that you did not enter into these Terms of Use in reliance upon any agreement, promise, representation, or understanding that is not contained herein.
